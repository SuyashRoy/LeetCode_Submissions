## **Problems Solved**

### **1. 1089: Duplicate Zeroes**

* **Problem Description:** This problem involves duplicating every occurrence of zero in a given list and shifting the rest of the elements to the right, while ensuring the modification is done in place. The goal is to achieve the duplication without exceeding the original array's length.

---

### **2. 1480: Running Sum of 1d Array**

* **Problem Description:** The task is to compute the running sum of an array where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements in the array from index `0` to `i`. The result should be stored in a new array, calculated in a single pass.

---

### **3. 1672: Richest Customer Wealth**

* **Problem Description:** Given an `m x n` grid representing bank accounts, where each element is the amount a customer has in a bank, return the maximum wealth any customer has. A customer's wealth is the sum of money across all their accounts.

---

### **4. 412: Fizz Buzz**

* **Problem Description:** For a given integer `n`, generate a string array where each index `i` contains:
* "Fizz" if divisible by 3,
* "Buzz" if divisible by 5,
* "FizzBuzz" if divisible by both, and
* the number itself if neither.

---

### **5. 1342: Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero**
* **Problem Description:** Given an integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. If the number is even, divide it by 2; otherwise, subtract 1.

---

### **6. 876: Middle of the Linked List**
* **Problem Description:** Given a singly linked list, return the middle node. If there are two middle nodes, return the second one.

---

### **7. 383: Ransom Note**
* **Problem Description:** Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise.

> Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

---

### **8. 485: Max Consecutive Ones**
* **Problem Description:** Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array.

---

### **9. 1295: Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits**
* **Problem Description:** Given an array `nums` of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

---


### **10. 977: Squares of a Sorted Array**
* **Problem Description:** Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
